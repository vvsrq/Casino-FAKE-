                Set limits: Decide beforehand how much fake currency you're comfortable "spending" and stick to it.<br>
                
                Take breaks: Step away from the games regularly to avoid getting carried away.<br>
                
                Don't chase losses: If you're not having luck, don't keep playing to try and win back your losses.<br>
                
                It's not real gambling: This simulation doesn't reflect the odds or risks of real casino gambling.</p>
